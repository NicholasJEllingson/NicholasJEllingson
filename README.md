Hello, I'm Nicholas Ellingson. I'm a Software Engineer who is working on learning and developing his skills. 
I am particularly interested in learning System Design, Object Oriented Programming, and Clean Code.
I am looking for repositories with well architected designs so that I can learn how to better utilize design patterns and OOP to create flexible and well designed systems.
I'm looking for opportunities to grow my skills in an environment where I can contribute via my strong fundamentals in C# and the .NET environment, while also learning from senior engineers and system architects.
